	<p>Using Azure App Service, as it enables us to build and host web applications in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. So it easy to create website and host it by using  <u>AZURE </u>as a platform for hosting.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><center><b><u>AZURE CHAT BOT SERVICE</u> </b></center></h2><br>
<br
<p>The Bot Framework, along with the Azure Bot Service, provides tools to build, test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots, all in one place. The Bot Framework includes a modular and extensible SDK for building bots, as well as tools, templates, and related AI services. With this framework, developers can create bots that use speech, understand natural language, handle questions and answers, and more.</p>
<br>

<p>Bots provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person - or at least an intelligent robot. They can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information, on to automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a sophisticated conversation that intelligently provides access to services.</p>
<br>
<p>A bot can be thought of as a web application that has a conversational interface. A user connects to a bot though a channel such as Facebook, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.</p>
<br>
<p>So, here I have created resource on Azure platform for creating computer vision cognitive service.</p>
